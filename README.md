1)	Java classes contain fields and methods and is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

2)	When you declare a variable, you tell the computer to reserve some memory for your program to store some data while instantiating a variable means that the classâ€™s memory is being allocated for a new object and returning a reference to that memory.
